      Following the project’s guidelines, this page is dedicated to documenting properly the development of our styles according to their historical inspiration. In this section, we will spend some words on the general process behind the development of RESONANCE.
      The structure of the three issues and their articles reflects a hierarchical form, composed of nested HTML elements, tags, and attributes. Collective classes and individual ids were added to help in the stylistic process of the different elements.
      Furthermore, we also semantically marked up the article, in order to create a filtering feature for highlighting meaningful elements in the different articles. For this purpose, the following categories were individuated across the issues:
<i>People, Places, Musicians, Newspapers, Streaming Services, Organizations, Websites, Events, Music genres, Album, Songs</i> & <i>Concepts</i>.

              <p class="titles style_title">ILLUMINISM</p>
                 <p class="style">Books played a decisive role in the Enlightenment, elevating European citizens’ consciousness and political awareness to new levels. Thanks to new a greater alphabetization, new discussion places (like cafes), and new techniques, the 1700s saw a greater spreading of printing culture all over Europe but also in America and the East.</p>
                 <P class="titles fonts_title">FONTS</p>
                <p class="fonts">Regarding fonts, the Enlightenment period saw a rise in typography with a bigger stroke contrast, stylized shapes with bracketed serifs, and round, bulbous terminals, fitting the Rational spirit of the era. Yet, also a revolutionary and radical aspect was involved, as these fonts are the first to break up with the classical handwritten tradition and to embrace progressively automatic typing: for this reason, they are called Transisionist (the most famous being the font Romains du Roi). The transition led to the most important trend in the period (particularly, from the second half of the century): the Neoclassical style, inspired by the geometric rationale of the Ancient World and expressed in fonts like Didot. The Didot family were among the first to set up a printing press in the newly independent Greece, which was also a great example of a struggle for national reasons for patriots all over Europe.
                <br>
                <!--img src="imgs/Didot_Doc_1.jpg" class="imgs_docs"-->
                    The typeface is based on a collection of related types developed from 1784–1811 by Firmin Didot. Firmin cut the letters and cast them as type in Paris, and his older brother Pierre used them in printing. Firmin was also the inventor of stereotypography, an innovation in the printing process that completely changed the book industry, allowing books to be printed less expensively. This opened book ownership and casual literacy up to the common person. We will consider the Didot style as the representative of the Enlightenment and thus build our style using Didot’s books as the main inspiration. Thus, we adopted two variants of Didot for our style: GSF Didot was used for the text body while Lynotype Didot Roman for titles and headings.
                </p>
                 <P class="titles layout_title">LAYOUT</p>
                <p class="layout">
                    Didot’s books were organized according to the typical choices of the Neoclassical spirit: minimal decoration, wide margins, and linear borders characterize their books.
                    The style adopted for the front page is the one we used for different elements in the articles:
                    <li>
                   <ul> •	The title is a Didot font, specifically called GFS Didot, all in caps with a semi-bold trait. The margins are wide and the letter spacing is evident so to organize them more vertically the content.</ul>
                <ul> •	The subtitle is separated from the title by a small hr element. It is again in Didot style but a different font called Linotype Didot Roman. and all in caps but without the bold effect. Margins, letter spaces, and line-height are wide to give the content a more vertical structure like in Didot’s books.</ul>
                <ul> •	The Didot Logo separates subtitles from the authors and publication date, which are a smaller version of the subtitle (20px instead of 30px).</ul>
                </li>

Finally, for the metadata panel heading, we used Adine-Kirnberg Regular, to recreate the handwriting of an archivist. Indeed, archivists commonly wrote on the first folio of a manuscript its title, which wasn't necessarily specified in the content, or some additional information such as the estimated date.

                 <p class="colors">Among the free medieval fonts we found, Hentimps Circlet was the one closest to our images of reference, whereas for the first letter of each paragraph as well as the headings, we used the Mayflower Antique font. Finally, for the metadata panel heading, we used Adine-Kirnberg Regular, to recreate the handwriting of an archivist. Indeed, archivists commonly wrote on the first folio of a manuscript its title, which wasn't necessarily specified in the content, or some additional information such as the estimated date.
