    SCRIVERE INTRO PER DOCUMENTATION
    Yet, with Resonance, we aim to offer a different idea of what a magazine could be, stretching the boundaries of this hundred-year-old definition. Resonance is a typographical experiment, that allows the reader to experience our articles’ selection through six different stylistic lenses. Digital technologies enable us to give a new spin to the reading experience, making it playful and creative. We are not only interested in the recreational side of things: with the Metadata Viewer, we aim to offer an enhanced reading experience, where entities, places, and other knowledge material can be easily recognized and studied by our readers!
